# Gungnir

**Gungnir** is an open-source control system designed to manage city street lights efficiently and cost-effectively. Built with simplicity, scalability, and interoperability in mind, Gungnir aims to provide municipalities with a reliable, taxpayer-friendly solution for smart lighting control.

## Project Goals
The core philosophy behind Gungnir is to develop a straightforward yet powerful system to minimize expenditure while maximizing functionality for citywide street lighting. This is achieved by focusing on the following principles:
- **Simplicity**: A system that works seamlessly with minimal complexity.
- **Interoperability**: Enabling easy integration with other systems via APIs.
- **Cost-Efficiency**: Optimizing for low operational and maintenance costs.

## Development Phases

### **Phase 1: Simplicity** *(Completed)*
The foundation of Gungnir focuses on delivering essential features:
- **Automated Lighting**: Streetlights turn on/off automatically based on sunset/sunrise calculations.
- **Real-Time State Awareness**: Gungnir tracks and records whether lights are on or off.
- **Manual Override**: Operators can manually control the lights as needed.
- **Load Staggering**: Prevents simultaneous activation to reduce strain on the power grid.

---

### **Phase 2: Interoperability** *(Completed)*
To extend its functionality, Gungnir provides:
- **API Support**: A robust API for third-party applications to interact with the system.

---

### **Phase 3: Open-Source Release** *(Completed)*
Gungnir is publicly available under the [AGPL v3 License](./LICENSE) to foster community contributions and transparency. New features are added based on user requests.

---

### **Phase 4: Feature Expansion** *(In Progress)*
The current focus is on integrating requested features:
- **Light Sensors**: Adding daylight sensors to dynamically adjust lighting.
- **Standalone Functionality**: Scheduled on/off behavior for cases of internet outages.
- **Coordinator Role**: Introducing a feature to streamline and optimize system management.

---

### **Phase 5: Impending Improvements** *(In Progress)*
Ongoing development is dedicated to enhancing the systemâ€™s scalability and robustness:
- **Database and Framework Improvements**: Transitioning from SQLite/Flask to PostgreSQL/production-ready frameworks.
- **Redundancy**: Implementing failover servers for improved uptime during maintenance or outages.
- **Containerization**: Packaging the system for easy deployment using Docker or similar tools.
- **TALQ Compliance**: Aligning the system with international standards for smart city infrastructure.
- **Enhanced Documentation**: Improving guides and references for developers and administrators.
